    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",

    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",

    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "Decision Tree:\n",
    "-  A practical application of decision tree would be anytime there is a decision to be made and we want to predict what that decision would be based on certain factors (called features).  One specific application of decision trees would be to determine which healthcare plan would be ideal for a member. The factors could be income, age, location, gender, family size, network coverage, health statuses, etc.\n",
    "- Decision trees are a nice visual representation of how the model is making the prediction. According to the sklearn documentation (link below), decision trees also require little preperation and work well on numerical and categorical data. I would choose a decision tree when I think that certain features (things I know that may affect the outcome) can help chunk the data in order to make a decision logically.\n",
    "- Decison trees tend to overfit by continually adding features to make the buckets more and more homogeneous. Eventually the model will not generalize well. This can be solved by specifying hyperperameters such as Minimum Sample Size per Leaf, Minimum Number of Samples per Split, or Maximum Number of Features. This model would perform poorly if it created too many and too small. \n",
    "- I chose this model because it will select the most important features that create the largest homogeneous buckets to eventually predict a persons income. The feature selection is done by reducing the entropy within each buckt. The entropy represent homogeniality. In other words, the lower the entropy,the more we know about the set in the bucket, and less combinations of the data can be made. If the data set is very diverse, the use of Random Trees could help by creating several decision trees and out of all of them choosing the path that occurs the most. \n",
    "\n",
    "SVM:\n",
    "- One specific example that comes to mind based on the type of work I do is to predict when a member of a healthcare plan will visit the emergency room vs urgent care. Based on features such as plan coverage, location, age of patient and even demographics like income and enthnicity could help predict the decision.\n",
    "-  It seems to me that SVM, would be the better choice when it is highly important to be accurate because I know that this model will work to not only minimize error but will work to widen the margin which ultimately will provide the best line of fit.\n",
    "- SVMs are not useful unless trying to predict a binary outcome such as yes/no. This is not a continuous outcome predictor. This model would perform poorly using highly skewed data because these points could pull the classification line in the wrong direction.\n",
    "- A SMV model works to fine tune a logistical regression model by maximizing the space between all points and the logistical regression line. The distance is the margin. SVM will work in this problem because the outcome is binary; either <50K or  >=50K. If I can find a line that best fits the model, using Gradient Descent I can work to minimize the error of mis-classified points and the margin error. Another reason is because according to the sklearn documentation (link below) SVM works well with high dimensional data. This could be the case as there are many features that we will evaluate in model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Methods - Boosting:\n",
    "- Ensemble methods have many practical applications as they work to take a combination of a group of the best models and make them into a sort of \"super\" model. Both examples I have given previously could also use ensemble methods, but I think it would be particularly helpful if after attempting a certain model and seeing the results just to not have high enough predictive rates to be satisfying. If accuracy was particularly important, I believe and ensemble method would be the best choice to classify all the points as correctly as possibe. \n",
    "- This model would perform well on data that can be linerally split using more than one line. This would give a nice visual representation of the data and predictions. Also, the type of modeling would do well when we have a lot of data points in which to classify. In this way we can look an many weak learners and combine them into a super learner.\n",
    "- A disadvantage I see to using this method is that one would need to know what the best learners were in order to combine them. This could take a lot of trial and error. I also think that this method could be more difficult to explain depending on the complexity of each individual model used,the tuned parameters for each model and the combination of each model. It could also be a problem of how many models to include and when to stop adding models to classify the data. Finally, as I am going to try boosting, in a larger dataset depending on how many models you use it could run slow because it has to run one model after the other. Each next model is based on the misclassified points so it's not built in parallel.\n",
    "- I chose the boosting ensemble method thinking not one single model method could get me the predictive performance I wanted. Again, I want high accuracy for the results and so may need to combine several algorighms. The ensemble method works to combine weak learners to get the best model. I would try the Boosting technique because it was mentioned that to incorrectly predict those that make >=50K would be very detrimental to the fundraising. The boosting technique will weight the points that are left unclassified so that the next model attepted will correctly classify those points and so. Once the models are combined we will have a better prediction of making >=50K.\n",

This model has the highest fscore for the testing data when done with 100% of the data which appears to be just above .7. The Decision Tree model actually performed very well on the training data, but not very well in the testing data which signified to me that the model overfitted with the training data which can frequently happen with decision trees.\n",

    "All three models performed well in terms of accruacy for all sizes of the testing data sets, but the AdaBoost model does perform slightly better than the others. However, precision is much more important for this classification so we will notice that the fscore looks to be a little over .7 when using the full training set. This is again the highest fscore of any of the models.\n",

    "**Answer: ** A classification model to predict people who make over $50K works to group people into categories (over 50K or under 50K) based on the elements like age and education level that are supplied. We will use the apporoach that we can find several mediocre models that predict income with some level accuracy and call these \"weak learners\". The weak learners don't have to be great because we will then find out what they are good at predicting and combine that with other models that are good at predicting other points to create a super model with the best prediction overall. The AdaBoost model works in this way. It will attempt to create an initial model of prediction for those who make over 50K and who makes less than 50K. Each model will be considered a \"weak learner\". It will then check to see who was classified correctly and incorrectly. For the incorrect data points it will add a value to that point in order to increase its importance. Simply put it places a much higher importance on points (or in this case people) who were misclassified. Next, using the new weighted data points, another model will be used to classify the data again. Because the misclassified points were deemed more important, the sencond model will make sure to classify those points correctly. This process will continue until all of the models have been built and can be combined for the most accurate prediction of what a person's income will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of  the good qualities about this model is that it will not overfit the data. That means that we can be sure that when new data is added about a person, the model will generalize well. If a model does not generalize well, when new data is added is will not be very accurate because the model was specifically fit for on the data it was built with.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the AdaBoost model has all of the weak learer models created it will combine them into a super model, or one that will best predict income. It does this by looking at all of the models created and determining which ones were best at predicting income and places a higher level of importance on those models. If model A performed better and model X only somewhat helped, we might find both usefull but weight model A's components with higher significance as to who makes over 50K.\n",

Education level I would expect to be a good predictor. Generally those that have higher education make more money than those that don't; however this is not always the case. Marital status would be important. Those that are married or in a relationship might have two incomes contributing and therefore make more money. Capital gain would be an important feature because it would show that those who have higher capital gain are probably making more money. Finally I would think native-country might help predict income. Some countries have lower average incomes, and that might be an indicator of lower income for a person."

The graph shows that of the 5 important features they only contribute about 1/2 the weight that age does. I did not select hours per week or relationship. I can see why hours per week would be helpful, but I thought that someone working 80 hours at minimum wage sometimes doesn't earn as much as someone part time with higher eductaion. Relationship I can see is similar to marital status. To me the graph shows that while age stands out as the highest weighted feature, the others continue to taper off in importance. But these five features contribute more than half of the other 8 features combined."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
